# Customer-Churn-Prediction

## Project Description:

This project aims to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service using historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics. By utilizing machine learning models, we aim to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscriptions, allowing businesses to take proactive measures to retain them. This analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and helps improve overall customer satisfaction and retention rates.

## Dataset:

For this project, we use a dataset containing historical data of customer subscriptions. The dataset includes various features such as customer demographics, usage behavior, and subscription details. These features are crucial in determining patterns and identifying factors that contribute to customer churn.

## Methodology:

Our methodology involves the following steps to develop an effective customer churn prediction system:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing features to prepare the data for model training.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementing and evaluating different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to identify the best-performing model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using Grid Search to optimize the hyperparameters of the best model (Random Forest) to improve its performance.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Analyzing the importance of various features in predicting customer churn to gain insights into key factors influencing churn.
- **Model Saving and Deployment:** Saving the trained model using joblib for deployment in a production environment and setting up processes for ongoing monitoring and retraining.

## Significance:

Predicting customer churn is critical for subscription-based businesses to understand their customer base better and take necessary actions to reduce churn rates. By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can implement targeted retention strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase overall revenue.

## Conclusion:

In summary, this project focuses on predicting customer churn using historical customer data and machine learning techniques. Through data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis, the project aims to develop a robust system for identifying customers at risk of churning. This contributes to a better understanding of customer behavior and enables businesses to implement effective retention strategies.
